# Source code for First Bayes

This repo contains the source code for [the R Shiny version of First Bayes](https://shiny-apps.stat.ubc.ca/FlexibleLearning/FirstBayes/Normal-Normal/). Each directory contains an `Rmd` file that generates the Shiny app (through `flexdashboard`) of each analysis. The `beta-binomial` repo also contains an activity sheet with questions.

The original First Bayes was developed by [Professor Tony O'Hagan](http://www.tonyohagan.co.uk/academic/) from The University of Sheffield. You can check it out [here](http://tonyohagan.co.uk/1b/).

This R Shiny version of First Bayes was developed by the Flexible Learning team at the Department of Statistics of The University of British Columbia. We have also developed activities to accompany each dashboard. Visit [StatSpace](https://statspace.elearning.ubc.ca/) to see them!
